To Do:

Correct squiggle fill

Correct Squiggles rectangle colour - DONE

Look at Circles movement (Its weirdly sporadic) - DONE

Restart sketch when new graphic is chosen - DONE

Make Circles colours 'Wobble' - DONE

Intelligent graphics choose (not the same graphic twice) - Currently on a rotor

Sguigle bright colour looks shit, sort it

For the squigle fill, concider alternating where the fading recs run

Incorparate 12 second reverb time into graphics

Concider changing the DONE in circles to when there is a gap in notes, e.i the circles grow as long as there is a note

The squigle line (white BG) needs something more

Work on Intro Screen

Make the circles grow more
