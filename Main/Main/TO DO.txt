To Do:

Correct squiggle fill

Correct Squiggles rectangle colour - DONE

Look at Circles movement (Its weirdly sporadic)

Restart sketch when new graphic is chosen

Intelligent graphics choose (not the same graphic twice)

Sguigle bright colour looks shit, sort it

Make Circles colours 'Wobble'

For the squigle fill, concider alternating where the fading recs run
